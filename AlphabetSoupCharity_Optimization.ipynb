        "\n",
        "The deep learning models developed for Alphabet Soup aimed to predict the success of funding applicants based on various input features. The first model (AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb) used two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons, achieving an accuracy of 72.7%. The second model (AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb) increased complexity with four hidden layers having 100, 50, 20, and 10 neurons, but achieved a slightly lower accuracy of 72.4%.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite not achieving the target model performance of over 75% accuracy, both models provided valuable insights. Adjustments were made in the second model, including increasing the cutoff value for binning rare occurrences, exploring different neural network architectures, and increasing the number of epochs to 200. These attempts aimed to improve model accuracy but did not yield significant improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moving forward, further optimization could involve fine-tuning hyperparameters, exploring more complex neural network architectures, and applying regularization techniques. Overall, while the models showed moderate success, there is room for improvement to enhance their predictive performance for funding application outcomes.\n",
